# Smart-Marker
A web application for registering participants at events, marking their attendance, and creating meeting reports.

This is the first stage of this app. I am building a utility in which people can create meetings, invite people to participate in the meeting, track their attendance, do some analytics on meeting participants and create report. 

I used Python, Flask, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, SQLalchemy and SQLlite. I intend to us Mongodb for the next stage of the app.

##Accomplished so far
<ul>
 <li>User sign up and create a meeting group on the platform</li>
 <li>User can then add members to the meeting group he has created. The program allows you to collect vital personal details from the participants</li>
 <li>Then the meeting coordinator, can then mark each participants meeting attendance. At the moment, on weekly basis.</li>
 <li>The program gives you a column to add comments on an absent participant, or just any general comment on a participant </li>
 
</ul>

##More to dos
After creating a meeting the cordinator would be able to invite the members to supplier their personal details by themselves

Once they submit their details they will be added to the meeting participants on the app.

When a cordinator opens the app, he can only see the members or partcipants in the group he has authored.

There is a summary page, at the moment, that the cordinators can view details of members attending their meetings and even do some 
anlytics on the participants in the meeting.

And more...features to come.
