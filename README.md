# Smart-Marker
A web application for registering participants at events and monitoring their attendance.

The first stage of this app. I am building a utility in which you can create meetings, invite people to participate in a meeting, 
and also track their attendance. 

##Accomplished so far
<ul>
 <li>User sign up and create a meeting group on the platform</li>
 <li>User can then add members to the meeting group he has created. The program allows you to collect vital personal details from the participants</li>
 <li>Then the meeting cordinator, can then mark each participants meeting attendance. At the moment, on weekly basis.</li>
 <li>The program gives you a column to add comments for an absent participant</li>
 
</ul>

##More to dos
After creating a meeting the cordinator would be able to invite the members to supplier their personal details by themselves

Once they submit the details they will be added to the meeting participants on the app.

When a cordinator opens the app, he can only see the members or partcipants in the group he has authored.

There is a summary page, at the moment, that the cordinators can view details of members attending their meetings and even do some 
anlytics on the participants in the meeting.

Once they recieve your invitation, they will be able to provide enough details about themselves that will directly go into 
your database.
